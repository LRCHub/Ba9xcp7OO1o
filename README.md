# Porter Robinson – Mother

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I was born in a sudden embrace,
I'm awake
So I study
the shape of your face
You take what you're given
I only wanna do
what's good for you
And at once,
I'm checking the doors in my way
I can't keep my hands
from my face
I said, "Mom, I'm so sorry"
She smiled and said, "Darling,
I don't want you to worry,
'cause I'm on your side
for the rest of your life
You'll never be alone,
don't you worry my child
And now there's an empty room
you outgrew
But I'm here for you,
oh, oh-oh-oh"
And I've known the feeling
you've had and it hurts
The comfort of being unknown
So something can prey on you
Oh, I don't need it
Oh, I won't grieve it
I'm on your side
for the rest of your life
You'll never be alone,
don't you worry my child
And now there's an empty room
you outgrew
But I'm here for you,
oh, oh-oh-oh
For the man that grew,
grew, grew, grew, grew
And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
All I wanna do is best for you
I'm on your side
for the rest of your life
You'll never be alone,
don't you worry my child
And now there's an empty room
you outgrew
I'll wait for you, oh, oh-oh-oh
I'm on your side
for the rest of your life
You'll never be alone,
don't you worry my child
And now there's an empty room
you outgrew
But I'm here for you,
oh, oh-oh-oh
